# Search Algorithms


Search algorithms are tools used to find specific items or information within data.
Common types include:
-  Linear Search for small datasets
-  Binary Search for sorted data
-  Hashing for key-based lookup
-  DFS/BFS for graphs
-  A* for pathfinding
-  Pattern/Text search algorithms for substrings
The choice depends on data characteristics and task requirements, with efficiency and data size being crucial factors.
